Markdown is used write content on web. It's the nerd way of writting web content. You can format the text easily while typing using some of the basic symbols like _asterisks_, _underscore_, etc. It's also called as plaintext language. Below I will show you how to use the markdown language to format the text on the go.

# Bold:
>To make text bold, surround the words with asterik( ** ).
Example: ** Hello **  - **Hello**

# Italics:
>To make text italics, surround the words with underscore( _ ).
Example: _ Hello _    - _Hello_
