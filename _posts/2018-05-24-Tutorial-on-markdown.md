Markdown is used write content on web. It's the nerd way of writting web content. You can format the text easily while typing using some of the basic symbols like _asterisks_, _underscore_, etc. It's also called as plaintext language. Below I will show you how to use the markdown language to format the text on the go.

# Bold:
>To make text bold, surround the words with asterik( ** ).
Example: \*\*Hello \*\*  - **Hello**

# Italics:
>To make text italics, surround the words with underscore( _ ).
Example: \_Hello\_    - _Hello_

# Headers:
>There are six type of headers. You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.
Example: \#Hello - ##Hello

# Links:
>Adding website links.
>>Inline link:
Example: >/[visit my Github/]/(https://github.com/gokul-gokz/)
>[visit my Github](https://github.com/gokul-gokz)
>>Reference link:
[link1]: https://github.com/gokul-gokz
[Reference Link]: [link-1]


# Images:
>Inserting images is also similar to links but prfixed with a exclamation mark. The text inside square brackets will give a description about the image and the image link should be inside the brackets.
Example:
Normal text
       \!\[\# Sample image\]\(http://octodex.github.com/images/octdrey-catburn.jpg\)
![# Sample image](http://octodex.github.com/images/octdrey-catburn.jpg)
