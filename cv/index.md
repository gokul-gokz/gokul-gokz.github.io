## Professional profile
------------------------
   "Expert robot software developer with proven track record in developing motion planning and deep learning algorithms for robots and integrating them using Robot Operating System(ROS)."\With an undergraduate degree in Robotics and two years of work experience in a robotics startup , I have gathered immense knowledge and hands on experience in making robots. Has efficiently lead a team of five in the development of a mobile humanoid robot named Intelligent Robot assistant(IRA). Also worked on the inverse kinematics and motion planning aspect of manipulators. I also have hands on integrating google cloud api's with custom modules in the robot.
